Prompt Engineering System
The Prompt Engineering System is a tool that allows users to input a description of their objective or task, specify scenarios along with their expected outputs, and generate multiple prompt options based on the provided information. The system also includes evaluation metrics to check whether the generated prompt candidates align with the input description. It integrates various components such as prompt generation, evaluation data generation, evaluation, and a user-friendly interface.
